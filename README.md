# dockerizedForkBomb
An implemented fork bomb with all of the computer slowing positives, without all of the computer crashing negatives

Running `./startUpScript` will run the fork bomb, while ensuring that this is occurring on a single process on your computer. Docker itself will eventually need to be killed with Activity Monitor, Task Manager, or by just stopping Docker Desktop.
